Project Title: BMI Calculator

Problem Statement:
Many individuals struggle to quickly assess their health status regarding body weight. Calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) manually can be tedious and prone to errors. This program solves this problem by providing an automated tool that calculates BMI based on weight, height, and gender. It determines the user's health category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese), helping them make informed decisions about their health.

Program Features
This Java application includes the following features:

Interactive Menu: A user-friendly console menu that loops continuously until the user chooses to exit.

Gender-Specific Logic: Separate calculation options for Males and Females to allow for gender-specific category adjustments (implemented via the BmiData class).

Input Validation: Uses error handling (try-catch) to prevent the program from crashing if the user enters invalid data (e.g., letters instead of numbers).

GUI Integration: Includes an option to launch a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version of the calculator.

Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes a custom class (BmiData) to handle data encapsulation and calculation logic, keeping the main code clean.
